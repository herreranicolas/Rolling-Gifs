# Rolling GIFs App

Rolling GIFs is a React app that allows users to browse and interact with GIF images from the Giphy API.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Netlify. You can access it [here](https://rolling-gifs.netlify.app/).

## Project Objectives

1. Create reusable components for effective composition.
2. Load 15 random images from the Giphy API at first render.
3. Retrieve categories from the Giphy API to populate the filter selector.
4. Implement a search filter to search for images based on user input.
5. Allow users to 'Like' images, showing the number of likes per image (in-memory only).
6. Implement 'Favorites' functionality to save selected images in-memory.

## Additional Features (Extra Points)

1. Implement functionality for loading more images.

## Project Guidelines

- Follow best practices in React:
  - Component composition for reusability.
  - Use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks appropriately.
  - Utilize state lifting for sharing data between sibling components.
  - Use fetch or Axios to retrieve data from the Giphy API.
